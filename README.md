## **What is Tumaio? (The "Product 101")**

Tumaio is an AI-powered personal finance manager (PFM) built for _everyone_—from a student budgeting for the first time to an expert managing a complex asset portfolio.

It gives you a single, clear, and _complete_ picture of your entire financial life:

> **Track Your Net Worth:** Finally see all your assets (cash, property, car) and liabilities (loans) in one place.
>
> **Master Your Budget:** Create flexible, powerful budgets that you can actually stick to.
>
> **Get AI-Powered Insights:** Understand your spending habits, get financial forecasts, and identify opportunities to save.
>
> **Plan Your Future:** Set and track your goals, from saving for a new car to planning for retirement.

## **The Problem: Why "Generic" PFMs Fail in Emerging Markets**

Generic PFM apps fail in high-inflation, emerging economies due to two critical, unaddressed failures:

<span style="color: red;">1.</span> **The "US-Centric" Failure:** Modern, powerful apps like **Monarch** are built 100% for the US/EU market. They are unusable as they rely on "open banking" APIs that simply do not exist in some emerging markets.

<span style="color: red;">2.</span> **The "Stale Global" Failure:** Existing "global" apps like **Spendee** have stagnated. They lack support, have shipped no new features, and—most critically—have **zero inflation awareness**, making their financial advice useless in a high-inflation environment.

<br />

## **The "Tumaio" Solution & Go-to-Market Strategy**

Tumaio is architected to solve this from the ground up.

> **The Solution:** An intelligent, "manual-first" platform that gives users the power to track _all_ their assets and get real, inflation-adjusted insights.
>
> **The GTM Strategy:** We start with a "beachhead" market: **Angola.** It is a market I know deeply that perfectly represents this problem. After validating and winning here, we will scale to other emerging markets facing the same challenges.

## **Product Roadmap (Phased Rollout)**

The "manual-first" approach is not a weakness; it is a **deliberate, strategic first step.**

- **Phase 1 (MVP):** Perfect the "manual-first" user experience. Give users complete control and prove our value by delivering the market's best budgeting, tracking, and net-worth tools.
- **Phase 2 (AI-Automation):** Use AI to make manual entry obsolete. I am engineering AI-native features like smart receipt scanning and PDF/CSV importers to automate 90% of the work.
- **Phase 3 (Direct Integration):** As the market matures and APIs _do_ become available, we will be in the #1 position to build direct bank integrations.

<br />

### **My Role: Solo Architect & 0-to-1 Builder**

As the solo founder, I am responsible for the **entire product lifecycle**:

- **Product Strategy:** Identifying the $1B+ market gap and defining the phased MVP.
- **Systems Architecture:** Designing the complete, scalable, and secure full-stack application.
- **Full-Stack Engineering:** Building the entire platform (API, database, UI) from a blank page.

## **🔐 Note: This is a "Showcase" Repo**

<br />

The core repositories for Tumaio are **private** to protect business IP.

This showcase exists to demonstrate my architectural, product, and engineering skills. My daily progress is reflected in my **dayily / 800+ contribution** streak on my GitHub profile.
